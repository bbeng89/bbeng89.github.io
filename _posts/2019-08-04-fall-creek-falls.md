Some locals gave me the location to a hidden waterfall nearby. They said it would be kinda hard to get to but worth it. They were right about both.

Also I have no idea how to use the GoPro yet. I learned that putting it on your head while hiking and climbing stuff makes shaky, terrible footage, mostly of the ground. Also realized I didn’t actually have it recording most of the time, including when booker climbed up the falls with me.
