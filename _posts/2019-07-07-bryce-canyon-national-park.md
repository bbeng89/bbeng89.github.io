<p>I got up early this morning and did the Fairyland Loop Trail at Bryce Canyon National Park. I was on the trail by 7am which was perfect. It was cool and I didn't run into another person for at least 2 hours. I did the trail counter-clockwise, so from the Fairytale trailhead I went right on the Rim trail. I definitely think this is the way to do it. Clockwise would have been much more difficult.</p>

<p>The trail was about 8 miles and took me 3 hours to complete. I can't recommend this trail enough.</p>

8 miles, 1,541 ft elevation gain, 3 hours , 241 photos, almost no one else on the trail. I think Fairyland Trail at Bryce is my favorite trail Iâ€™ve ever hiked.
