<p class="text-justify">I decided to head back to Las Cruces, New Mexico, so I can join some friends that are camped there. My first stop today was in Phoenix where I met up with some family members and also picked up some gear for a new solar install that I'm going to be working on. From there I wanted to at least get out of the city before crashing somewhere for the night, so I ended up staying in Casa Grande. Planning to head out early in the morning so I didn't even bother to unhitch.</p>
