Booker and I got up early and did an 8 mile hike up to Harney Peak and back. The views up there were spectacular. I never really knew South Dakota was so scenic.

Someone saw me and Booker climb out to this peak and took a picture of us out there. They later found me on the trail and sent me the pic.
