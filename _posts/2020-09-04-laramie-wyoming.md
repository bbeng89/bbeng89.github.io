After 12 days of battling them, the mice at my last campsite finally beat me. I had spent an entire day "mouse-proofing" the rig by sealing all the cracks and holes with spray foam, and I thought it had worked until last night I heard them in my wall. That was the last straw for me, so I packed up and went a few miles down the road to an RV park where hopefully I'm free from the mice and can spend some more time trying to figure out how they're getting in.
