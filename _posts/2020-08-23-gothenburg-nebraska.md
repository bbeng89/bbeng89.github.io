Tonight we're crashing at a small county park called Lafayette Park Campground in Gothenburg, Nebraska. I'm not unhitching since I plan to leave early, so unfortunately I can't go check out the town. I saw part of it on the way in though and it looked really neat and historic. The campground has a little covered bridge you can walk through and that takes you to a bunch of walking trails that go around a small lake, which Booker and I checked out after getting set up. Overall this seems like a great spot to spend the night.
