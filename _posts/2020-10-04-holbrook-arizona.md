After leaving Lake Powell I decided to head towards Petrified Forest National Park as I had never been there before. Looking around on campendium it seemed that camping in this area was really limited. I couldn't find any BLM land or any real boondocking, and even RV parks were limited. I did manage to find this gift shop that people were saying allowed you to camp overnight for free so I decided to give that a shot. I made it out here and the lady was super nice and sure enough told me I could camp for free. I'm the only one out here and have a picnic table and a pavilion. I've definitely paid for worse sites than this.
