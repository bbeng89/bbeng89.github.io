I decided I'm going to make the journey back to the Midwest so that I can visit family and friends and do some maintenance on the rig. My goal for today was to get to Dodge City, Kansas, but when I checked the weather forecast I saw they were predicting 70mph winds throughout all of Southeastern Colorado, which was basically my entire route. After being out here a couple weeks I noticed that the mornings are calm and the wind picks up throughout the day, so I decided to completely pack everything and hitch up last night, so that this morning all I would have to do is pull the slide in and then take off. My dad's side of the family is notorious for leaving extremely early in the morning, so I channeled my inner Bengtson and managed to get out on the road by 4:45 AM.

This actually ended up being awesome, not only because I managed to miss most of the really bad wind, but also because I got to see the sunrise as I was driving through the mountains.

Once you get over the mountains, Eastern Colorado is basically just flat plains, and the sunrise wasn't too shabby there either.

Now I'm staying the night at an RV park where I have hookups for the first time since Tucson, back in February. It looks like the Kansas winds are going to be howling again  tomorrow so it's probably going to be another early morning.
