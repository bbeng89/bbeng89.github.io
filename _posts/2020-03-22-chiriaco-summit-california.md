<p class="text-justify">I reached out to some other full-timer friends and they invited me to come stay with them on BLM land outside Joshua Tree. They have a pretty large group (about 10) and have been here for a couple weeks now. Since I just came in off the road they are having me do a 14 day quarantine where I have to keep my distance from the rest of the group. These are tough times and everyone is scared, so I completely understand their caution.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I'm glad to have a safe spot where I can lay low for a while, but I'm going to have to make a decision about what I'm going to do next. I think it's pretty safe to say that things aren't going to just return to normal, and I think this trip is going to have to come to an end soon. I'm going to think on it, keep an eye on the news, and try to make a decision in the next couple weeks. For now I've stocked up on food, have 100 gallons of water, and got my solar panel working again, so I should be able to sit here comfortably for a couple weeks.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Hope everyone is staying safe out there. </p>
