Today my buddy Josh took me fly fishing for the first time. I didn't catch anything, but it was still a great experience.

Today is also my last day camping in this spot on the mountain. I've been here a week now. The first 4 days were really rough due to the snow, but yesterday it warmed up and all the snow melted, so now I'm kind of bummed to be leaving. This was an incredible spot. I'm moving down into the nearby town so that I can have full hookups and spend another week exploring this area.
