I'm working my way back East now and realized that Albuquerque would probably be my last chance to Boondock, so I'm spending a couple nights in a spot I've stayed at before, outside of Edgewood, NM.

Also, I finally broke down and tried Blake's Lotaburger. I've seen these all over New Mexico and always laughed at the name, but decided I had to try it. I've gotta say, the Green Chile burger was amazing.
