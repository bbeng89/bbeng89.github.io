<hr/>

<p>I was staying in McKinney Falls just outside Austin, but wasn't able to keep my spot through the holidays. Luckily I was able to find another campsite about 30 miles West of Austin in Dripping Springs.</p>

<p>This is where we ended up spending Christmas. My buddy Patrick was also in town so we spent Christmas Eve playing board games at his place.</p>
