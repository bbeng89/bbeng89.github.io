[One year ago]({% post_url 2019-04-26-macomb-illinois %}) I left Illinois and set out on the road with my dog, my truck, and my camper. Around the New Year I wrote a [post]({% post_url 2019-12-27-2019 %}) reflecting a bit on 2019, but now that I've got a full year under my belt I wanted to revisit how I ended up in this lifestyle, what the experience has been like, and how it's changed me.

Over the last year I've met a lot of other "full-timers" and it seems like many of them have some kind of story about how they got there. Most people don't just abandon their traditional lifestyles one day, sell all their belongings, and move into an RV. Or if they do, it's usually short-term, and is more like an extended vacation. But the true full-timers, the ones that have no interest in living like everyone else, typically have a story. Like many of these people, I never could have imagined that one day I would be living this way. For me, the story started back in 2016 when my marriage came to an abrupt end. That single event changed the course of the rest of my life. 

When your life is upended overnight, and the future that you thought you saw for yourself is gone and replaced with total uncertainty and unknown, your first gut reaction is to try to replace what you lost so that you can get back to the way things were. I spent about a year and a half in this state, and it was miserable. I think this was largely because I was never content with the life I had been living. I had the traditional 9-5 cubicle job, the house in the cul-de-sac, and kids were the next item on the list. I always believed this was how you're supposed to live. I didn't question it and never really considered anything else. But when I found myself starting over and having to once again chase after something that deep down I didn't even want in the first place, I found myself becoming bitter, resentful, and despondent. 

After a long string of disappointments and general misery, I eventually started immersing myself in reading, writing in journals, and introspective thinking. I gravitated towards stoic philosophy and ideas of self-reliance and liberty. I was tired of always chasing after things I didn't have and relying on other people for my happiness and well being. It was through these ideas that I was finally able to accept that I didn't need to live by anyone's expectations, and that I had nothing to lose. I was able to embrace the uncertainty and the unknown and rather than fear it, treat it as an asset. This was a powerful realization. For the first time in my life, it felt like I was in control and anything was possible. 

The next realization after this "awakening" was that I didn't want 90% of what I had. "Things" felt like anchors. The thought of picking up and moving somewhere else was daunting because I would think about the logistics of all my physical belongings. I realized it was stuff I didn't need anyway, stuff that I had acquired to try to fill a void that couldn't be filled with possessions. I knew I wanted to live a minimalist life, unshackled from "stuff". This got me thinking about moving into a very small living space, where I would be limited to only the necessities and a few things that were really important to me. A place where material desires would always be kept in check by the simple fact that I wouldn't have a place for them. I know this is cliche, and sounds like the standard speech you hear on one of those "tiny home" TV shows, but I started to understand that mindset and it was genuinely how I was beginning to feel. 

My first thought was to sell my house and buy another house that was very small and inexpensive. I was looking around at places under 800 sqft that would have a very minimal mortgage payment that could be paid off quickly. But that nagging feeling of it being an "anchor" kept coming back. I kept asking myself why I would stay in Springfield, Illinois when there was nothing keeping me there anymore. I may be in the minority on this, but I actually liked Springfield a lot. I think it's a great town and I had a lot of friends there, but I felt that my worldview was too narrow and that I needed to see what else was out there. At this point my buddy made the suggestion that maybe I should buy a cheap camper and come live out on his farm with him until I figured out what I was going to do. It seemed kind of absurd at first, but after several weeks I found that I couldn't get it out of my head. In my free time I was looking at campers online, doing research about how the logistics of it would work, how I'd deal with winter, etc. Then it dawned on me... if I lived in a camper, my house would literally be on wheels. I could move it whenever and wherever I want. And if I could find a remote job, I could just be on the move all the time and wouldn't have to worry about winter. I could also see everything I ever wanted to. This was the inception of the plan. 

My daydreaming and half-assed researching turned into action and dedicated purpose. I started a notebook where I planned out every detail of how this would work. I was very careful not to broadcast these plans, because I believe that talk is usually counterproductive to action. I wasn't going to start telling people about it until it was solidified and there was no going back. I came up with three major steps that needed to happen. Step 1: get a remote job. This was the key to everything and would make the whole thing possible. Abandoning my career was simply never an option for me. While I try to be a minimalist, I know that money is still necessary for freedom. Step 2: Sell the house, and do it without a realtor in order to maximize the profit. This way I would have a lot more cash to funnel into an RV. Step 3: Buy an RV and hit the road. 

If I hadn't put such an immense amount of work into it, I would say that the way these three steps fell into place was fate. My favorite client at my job had grown to a point where it made sense for them to bring development in-house, so once I recognized this I reached out to them and after some back and forth, they made me a job offer. It was a lateral move salary-wise, but one with a lot of potential. I was going to help them build something from the ground up and would be an owner in the company. It was an opportunity for me to have my own thing, where I had a say in the direction of the company and felt a connection to the product. It was honestly one of the highest goals I had for my career, much more important to me than salary. Furthermore, the entire company was remote, so not only was I able to accomplish my career goal of working on my own product, but it also pushed me on to the second step of my plan. 

With the remote job locked in, I got right to work selling the house. I did my research on how to list and price it, I set up a website, created signs, and had professional photos taken of the house. At the same time as I was doing all of this, I was also selling off a lot of my belongings. When I finally felt everything with the house was ready, I put the listing up on Zillow and three days later sold it to the first people that looked at it. I paid $200 for the professional photos, and $500 to a lawyer to do all the paperwork, and that was the extent of my expenses. The crazy thing is that I never once felt fear or uncertainty about anything I was doing. I was so driven by this one purpose that with each step I was just thinking about moving on to the next one. I can honestly say that I had never felt this level of motivation or purpose in my life to that point. Now that I was working remotely and no longer had a house tying me down, I was completely free. 

I closed on the house in the beginning of December, and knew I wanted to be on the road by April, so that gave me five months to get an RV and get it ready for full-time living. Many full-timers that I talk to say they looked at hundreds of rigs before finally finding the right one. This wasn't how I approached it at all. I made a simple list of requirements and decided I would buy the first one I found that met them all. I had done some looking online but ended up finding one that met all my requirements at the first dealership I went to. It was a used 2013 26' Jayco. It was a decent brand, wasn't too big or too small, could be towed by my truck, had space for a full desk, and I could afford to buy it outright. Done. Could I have spent another couple months and countless hours looking around to find something a little better? Yeah, probably. But this got me out on the road immediately. There was no deliberating, no time for doubt, just action. 

It was only a matter of weeks after I sold my house that I bought the RV. I picked it up at the end of December and towed it three hours back to my parents barn in Macomb. I remember when they hitched it up to my truck and basically said, "See ya later!" I couldn't stop thinking, "They're really going to let me tow this thing?" I'd never towed anything in my life. Aside from the rude awakening of what my gas mileage was going to be, and nearly taking out a pump trying to pull into a gas station, the maiden voyage went pretty well I think. I now had four months to work on it and get it ready for travel in April.

At this time I was living at my parents lake place in the Lake of the Ozarks, waiting until April when I would set out. I was swamped with work at my new job and wanted to have my own space without distractions. I would occasionally make weekend trips back to Macomb to work on the trailer, but most of these four months were spent alone in the Ozarks. This turned out to be a very difficult period. I was eager to get out on the road, but what turned out to be more challenging than the anticipation was the isolation down there. I would go days, sometimes over a week, without even seeing another human. That area is completely empty in the winter and at times it felt like I was the last person on Earth. I've always preferred being alone and have no trouble keeping myself occupied, but this was extreme even for me. I think it's a good thing I bought my rig as quickly as I did because it would have been easy for doubt to creep in during this period of time. Luckily I had everything all ready to go and there was no turning back. In the end, this turned out to be a valuable experience as I would certainly experience periods of isolation once I got out on the road as a solo traveler. Those four months taught me how to deal with true solitude in a way I hadn't experienced before, and as this COVID-19 thing is proving, a way that many people aren't equipped to handle. 

At the beginning of April I decided to start "test running" my RV living by moving into the camper and staying at campgrounds around Illinois. I stayed at campgrounds in Macomb and Springfield over the course of several weeks. This was also a great experience because at that time the campgrounds were all empty, as it was too cold for most of the weekenders. This allowed me to practice towing, backing, setting up and tearing down, and using the dump stations without having to worry about a bunch of people being around. It also gave me a chance to see what it was really going to be like to live in an RV. I spent about two weeks camping like this and getting a feel for it, before finally heading out on April 26th. 

One thing that I haven't brought up yet, but that deserves mentioning, is my family's reaction to all of this. I knew my sister would be supportive because she's pretty much always supportive of everything I do, but I was certain the rest of my immediate and extended family would think I was nuts and would give me a hard time about it. That couldn't have been further from the truth. My aunt and uncle in St. Louis helped me find my camper. Everyone chipped in and bought me things I needed for Christmas. My parents rearranged their machine shed so I could store the camper there for four months, then helped me work on it to get it ready. They helped me move all of my remaining stuff from Springfield to a storage unit in Macomb (this included forgetting the key to the storage unit in Springfield and my mom driving back at 4am to get it). They came out to visit me when I was camping around Illinois (and later all the way across the country in Utah and Montana). I could tell they were always kind of leery of what I was doing, and they probably weren't thrilled with the idea, but not a single person ever discouraged me. For that I'm very grateful. 

The day I left Macomb was kind of unusual because my family was all out of town. We had said our good-byes and everything before they left, but on the actual day I set out there was no one around and no send-off. I just got in the truck and left, which I realize now was probably the best way to do it. The first stop was my grandparents house in Missouri, as it was on my way and I wanted to say good-bye to them as well. This blog picks up around then, so you can see the route I traveled from there. 

Once I was actually out on the road I found that I got into the rhythm of things pretty quickly. Obviously in the early days I did some stupid things, but I learned as I went and everything eventually became streamlined and natural. When I first started I would go to a lot of RV parks because the hookups were nice and I could count on having internet. As I got more comfortable I became more adventurous, eventually starting to "boondock," which is free dispersed camping, usually out in national forests and BLM land. Camping this way is so much better because you usually have a lot more privacy. You're actually out in nature and can hike, mountain bike, shoot guns, and just enjoy the overall freedom that comes with being in a remote place. Also it's completely free. I started camping like this with just a generator, but now I've worked my way up to 800W of solar on my roof which is pretty much my sole source of power now. On this blog you can find [various posts]({{ site_url }}/articles) I've written detailing my journey through boondocking. At the time I'm writing this, I've been completely off the grid for over 70 consecutive days, about half of which have been with new friends that I've made on the road.

On the topic of friends, I recognized early on that I needed to start putting myself out there so that I would meet people. I knew that it wasn't feasible for me to live alone out here without any human interaction, and flashbacks to those four months in the Ozarks were a constant reminder of this fact. It took me a while to fully shed the insecurities and awkwardness of doing social things alone, but I got used to it and eventually came to really like it. I would go out to bars and restaurants, strike up conversation with anyone that was willing, and see what happened. Just doing this I exchanged a ton of phone numbers, got invited to parties, and even made a couple close friends that I still keep in touch with. Most of the time I would also try to bring Booker along, partially because I like having him with me and didn't want him to be alone in the camper, but also because he's a really good conversation starter and icebreaker. I also made sure to never pass up a social opportunity in any of the places I was camped. A lot of RV parks will have social events and I would go to all of them, even when I was the only one there under retirement age. You meet a lot of younger people boondocking and I've had countless great conversations, and met some very odd and interesting characters, just by never passing up an opportunity to talk to someone. A big part of living this way is being spontaneous and not passing up opportunities that present themselves. I met my friends Matt and Kelsey while hiking in the Black Hills. They needed a map, so I asked if I could just hike with them and we could share mine. A couple hours later they decided they would come out to the [badlands]({% post_url 2019-09-04-wall-south-dakota %}) and boondock with me. Now we've become very close friends and have actually been camping together for the past couple weeks.

Working full-time while traveling and living nomadically has also been an interesting experience with a bit of a learning curve. I was fortunate that I had several months of working fully remote before setting out, so I was able to adjust during that period. But with the amount of traveling I'm doing now, I've had to adopt a fairly unconventional schedule. I try to keep my long distance travel on the weekends so that it doesn't interfere with the normal work week, since I still have a lot of meetings and conference calls I have to attend. However, for the most part I really don't have the Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 schedule that I used to. My work is all task-based, rather than time-based, so I have projects and deadlines that I have to meet, but have the freedom to work on them whenever I choose. This allows me to be flexible so I can spend the day going for a hike or checking out a nearby city, then work in the evening or on weekends. I bring my laptop with me just about everywhere I go though, because I never know when something might pop up. I've had situations where I was towing and had to pull over to the side of the road to reboot servers. Sometimes I have to step back and realize how crazy this is, but the craziness keeps life exciting. With this type of schedule I no longer have that "Monday blues" feeling, but I also don't have the "TGIF" feeling. Everything blurs together in a mix of work and life. This certainly isn't for everyone, but for me it's perfect. 

Surprisingly, this blog and my Instagram account have also been really valuable to me on this journey. I started the blog early on in my travels with the intention of using it only to let my family members know where I was and to see photos of what I was doing. I know that my family and friends still like it for this purpose, but it's also been beneficial to me personally as a way to document experiences and things I'm learning, and to go back and reflect on them later. It helps remind me of how grateful I am for everything that I've been able to do, and how far I've come from that place I was in back in 2016. Doing this has also opened my eyes to something unexpected, and that is how slow time passes now. It feels like I've been out here for ages, and that's because every day is new and exciting. When you don't live for the present day, and instead live for a few days or weeks out of the year where you get to really do what you want, it's easy to let life pass you by. For me, this one year has felt longer than the 10 that preceded it just due to the incredible number of new experiences and memories, and the fact that I have just lived one day at a time.

On a deeper level, I feel that this journey has fundamentally changed me for the better. The bitterness, fear, and negativity that were my constant companions before are now gone and replaced with optimism and an excitement for life. I see the good in people now rather than immediately assuming the worst. Those core principles of stoicism, self-reliance, and liberty are stronger in me now than ever. I try to live simply and focus on creating new experiences with the things I have rather than always wanting for something else. I've become more confident and willing to try things for myself and take risks. I don't know how long I'll live on the road, and that's okay because these days I am perfectly content. This doesn't mean that I don't have goals and aspirations for my life, because I certainly do. But my goals are now my own, not anyone else's. 

I think the most important thing I've learned from this whole journey is that any situation in life becomes whatever you make of it. A terrible tragedy can break you, or it can cause a rebirth. There are external things that can and will happen to you and are completely out of your control. What you can control is your reaction to them. As Marcus Aurelius said in Meditations, "Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?"
