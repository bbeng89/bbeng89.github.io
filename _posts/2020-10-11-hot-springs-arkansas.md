I read that getting a site in Gulpha Gorge Campground (the National Park Campground) could be pretty difficult, so I decided to get up early this morning and try to time it so that I was arriving just after everyone was checking out. This meant I got to see a beautiful sunrise on my way out of Oklahoma.

After about 10 minutes on the road I drove straight into a really thick fog and was in this for most of the way through Oklahoma. Visibility on the road was bad, but it still looked pretty awesome.

Once I got into the mountains of Arkansas the fog actually came back a for a bit too. I thought it looked really cool when I could see the fog in the distance before driving into it. I honestly had no idea Arkansas was so beautiful. It reminded me a bit of Missouri but even more hilly and mountainous. Also being here in the fall when the leaves are changing colors is amazing.

When I finally got to the campground the place was kind of chaotic, as a lot of people were trying to leave at the same time as a lot of people were arriving. There was only one site along the creek that was open (the most popular spot), even though I showed up at checkout time on a Sunday. This site was one of the more challenging ones I've had to back into because there was a big tree right on the corner of the site. Luckily one of the campground workers came over and spotted for me so we got it in there pretty quickly.

I'm really glad a got a site on the creek because it's really pretty and I can actually hear the creek running from inside the rig.
