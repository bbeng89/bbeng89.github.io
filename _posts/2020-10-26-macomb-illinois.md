![parked in macomb]({{ site.cdn }}/img/destinations/illinois/macomb-4.jpg)

Due to a change in circumstances Iâ€™m going to be parking the rig for a couple months to focus on work. The big downside is that I have to experience illinois winter again. The upside is that I will get some quality time with my friends and family. Illinois friends, hit me up!
