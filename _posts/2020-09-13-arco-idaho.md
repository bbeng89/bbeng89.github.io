We're all set up in Arco. I decided to come here because I wanted to check out Craters of the Moon National Monument but what I didn't realize was that this entire area is covered in smoke from the forest fires. Most of the drive here was thick with smoke and I couldn't even really see the mountains. So I'm not too optimistic about what I'm going to see at Craters of the Moon.

I decided to get a spot at an RV park because I couldn't really find any good boondocking in the area, and also because Craters of the Moon doesn't allow dogs so I want to make sure Booker at least has A/C if I have to leave him behind. This is actually a really nice park though and it's nice to have some hookups and showers for a couple days.
