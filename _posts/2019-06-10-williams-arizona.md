    Found a great spot near Williams, AZ, just outside Flagstaff in Kaibab National Forest.

I don’t have cell service at my campsite so this has been my office for the past week. Finding a quiet place with WiFi that lets me bring my dog and stay all day was a tall order so I’m super grateful to Brewed Awakenings. If you’re ever in Williams, AZ definitely hit them up!
