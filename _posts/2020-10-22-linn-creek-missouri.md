Spending the night at Seven Springs Winery just outside the Lake of the Ozarks. I'm using my Harvest Hosts membership to camp here, which has been a really great program. I haven't used it as much as I'd like, but in cases where I just need a night and don't feel like staying at something like a Walmart, it's perfect. If you're interested in joining Harvest Hosts you can use [this link](http://harvesthosts.refr.cc/blake1) to get 15% off.
