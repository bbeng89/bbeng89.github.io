A group of at least 20 bighorn sheep just walked through our campsite. I was actually able to get my camera out and get some decent shots this time.

I randomly met Matt and Kelsey hiking in the Black Hills and we hit it off right away. After hanging out a few days in Custer they decided to come join me in the badlands. Camping with these guys on the edge of a cliff for the last 3 days has been such an awesome experience.
