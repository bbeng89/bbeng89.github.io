COVID-19 actually just created one of the coolest experiences I’ve had yet... having Joshua Tree National Park to myself. No vehicles are allowed in, so I took my bike and climbed 7 miles to get out to some trails. The climb was brutal but flying down 7 miles of pavement on the way back with no cars and no people was incredible. It was almost eerie being so alone in such a big place.
